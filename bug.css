The following CSS rule is causing unexpected behavior:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

This code intends to make two divs sit side by side, each occupying 50% of the parent container's width. However, the `float: left` property can cause issues.  If the parent container doesn't have a defined width, the divs will collapse to their content width, and not fill the full 50% intended.
